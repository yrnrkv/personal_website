# Welcome to My Blog

This is a placeholder blog post to get you started.

## Getting Started

To add your own blog posts:

2. Add front matter with `title`, `publishedAt`, and `summary`
3. Write your content in Markdown format

## Example Front Matter

```yaml

title: "Your Post Title"
publishedAt: "2025-01-15"
